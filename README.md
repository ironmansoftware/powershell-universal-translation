# PowerShell Universal Translation Files

This repository contains the open source translation files for PowerShell Universal. These files are synchronized with PowerShell Universal builds to provide translated strings for the admin console and other resources. 

## Contributing

Contribute to our Weblate project to introduce new translated strings, update strings or add languages. During development of a new version, strings will be added to the Weblate project or the GitHub repository. 

## Release Schedule 

A new tag and release will be created with each PowerShell Universal release. RESX files will be downloaded from the repository and included with PowerShell Universal builds. 

## Licensing

The license for this project does not apply to the core PowerShell Universal product and only the translated strings themselves.
